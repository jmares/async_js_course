The API used in the course doesn't exist anymore. The url `restcountries.eu` redirects to `countrylayer.com` where you have to register. Instead, I used `restcountries.com`. Here you have two possibilities:

- use `https://restcountries.com/v2/all` so you can stick as close to the course as possible (*flag* is different though)
- use `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all` which will require you to make some changes to the code

I used the latter and limited the amount of countries by using `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/region/europe`.
