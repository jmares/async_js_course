The API used in the course doesn't exist anymore. The url `restcountries.eu` redirects to `countrylayer.com` where you have to register. Instead, I used `restcountries.com`. Here you have two possibilities:

- use `https://restcountries.com/v2/all` so you can stick as close to the course as possible (*flag* is different though)
- use `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all` which will require you to make some changes to the code

I used the latter and limited the amount of countries by using `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/region/europe`.

Not as interesting as the first part.

### Part 4: Promises

Much better than the previous two parts. Replace `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all` with `https://restcountries.com/v2/all` if you want to stick as close to the course as possible or use `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all` if you want to use the latest version. See also part 1.

A simple and good introduction to promises, but I wouldn't call it a deep dive.
